= Redmine Project Show plugin

Project Show is a Redmine plugin to show how simple it is to override default views.  This partial one displays the sub-projects in a more readable list instead of the comma separated one.  Doing it within a plugin is better than changing the core as when you go thru updates to Redmine you won't have to go back and make the changes again.  I got tired of having to do this for multiple installs and versions fso I think the plugin is a btter idea.
